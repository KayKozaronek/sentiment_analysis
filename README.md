# Sentiment Analysis

## What does it do?
This project analyzes Movie reviews and their sentiment using simple linear classifiers.

## What is it? 
This project includes working implementations of the following algorithms from scratch:
- Perceptron (Single step, Full, and Average)
- Hinge Loss
- Pegasos


The code is supposed to classify unseen reviews and classify their sentiment as either positive or negative.

## What technologies are used? 
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Python
  
## What is the ambition of the project? 

The sole purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of the foundational math behind these algorithms and exercise building them from scratch.

## How to run the code?  
running `main.py` in the scripts folder will run the algorithms on a dataset and report the following: 
- training set error
- test set error 
- most predictive words
