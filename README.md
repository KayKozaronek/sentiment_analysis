# Description
This project analyzes Movie reviews and their sentiment using simple linear classifiers.

This project includes working implementations of the following algorithms from scratch:
- Perceptron (Single step, Full, and Average)
- Hinge Loss
- Pegasos


The code is supposed to classify unseen reviews and classify their sentiment as either positive or negative. 

Here are the important technologies used: 
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Python
  

The sole purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of the foundational math behind these algorithms and exercise building them from scratch.


running main.py in the scripts folder will run the algorithms on a dataset and report the following: 
- training set error
- test set error 
- most predictive words
